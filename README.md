## Overview

Campus Bite is the web control interface for an innovative automated food distribution robot system developed by Mechatronics Engineering students at SLIIT (Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology). This modern, responsive web application enables real-time monitoring, control, and management of the robotic delivery system, bridging the gap between advanced robotics and user-friendly web technology.

The system combines mechanical engineering, electronics, automation, and modern web development to create an efficient campus food delivery solution.

npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables (if needed)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables:
```env
VITE_API_URL=your_robot_api_url
VITE_APP_TITLE=Campus Bite
VITE_ROBOT_WS_URL=your_websocket_url
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace the placeholder values with your actual robot system credentials. Never commit the `.env` file to version control.

### Step 4: Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
